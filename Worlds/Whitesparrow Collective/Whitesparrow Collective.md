- The Six Truths of the World 
	- Whitesparrow is a collective of multiple settlements and communities within the Myria mountain range. It is a long journey to the next city-state, so Whitesparrow has some but limited contact with neighboring kingdoms and towns. Still, the collective is in a growth period.
	- Whitesparrow has a town center which is home to a large research institution and many different guilds of industry and art. 
	- Beneath a smaller settlement of Whitesparrow is the ruin of an ancient civilization that historical scholars are only beginning to understand.
	- Magic in this area is not a common occurrence. Divine magic is widely accepted as those members become healers of their community. Arcane magic is even more rare. Some revere it, some fear it.
	- Monsters are a daily threat to Whitesparrow Collective, necessitating a guild of monster hunters who operate as town security.  
	- Recently a settlement on the outskirts of the Collective was razed by a dragon attack, resulting in many displaced refugees needing support and housing.
- What is the tone of this world? 
	- The vibes are studio Ghibli, soft magic, esoterica. 
	- Gameplay will be a collection of interaction and exploration.  Violence is a part of this world, but not always a direct threat.
